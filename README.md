### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

After creating the repository, you need to enable GitHub Pages. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository's `Settings` tab.
2. Navigate to the `Pages` section.
3. Choose `GitHub Actions` as the source for your GitHub Pages.
4. Click `Save` to apply the changes.

### 3. Add your data

To customize your website, follow these steps:

<summary>3. How to <b>update</b> my repository with the latest version of Jake?</summary>

Since Jake is a template repository, users who create repositories from it won't automatically receive updates when changes are made to the original template. To update your repository with the latest changes while preserving your custom data (such as the `data.toml` file), follow these steps:

1. **Create a backup of your custom data:**

   - Before updating, make sure to back up the `data.toml` file or any other files that contain your specific customizations, as these may be overwritten during the update process.

2. **Sync with the latest version of Jake:**

   - In your repository, click on the "GitHub Desktop" or use the command line to fetch the latest changes from the original template.
   - You can do this by adding the original repository as a remote:

     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/thevahidal/jake.git
     git fetch upstream
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

   - This will merge the latest changes from the Jake template into your repository.

3. **Resolve any conflicts:**

   - If there are conflicts, especially in files like `data.toml`, youâ€™ll need to manually merge the updates from the template with your custom data. The `data.toml` file is where your personal data is stored, so be careful not to overwrite your custom settings.

4. **Push the changes:**

   - Once you've resolved any conflicts, commit the changes and push them back to your repository.

5. **Review your site:**
   - After updating, review your website to ensure everything is still functioning as expected. You can monitor the progress of the update in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your repository stays up to date with the latest improvements from the Jake template while preserving your personal customizations.

### Local Development

If you'd like to test or customize this project locally without triggering GitHub Actions, follow the steps below to set up and run the pipeline on your machine.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (You can install Poetry via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/): `pipx install poetry`)

#### Steps for Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jake.git
cd jake
```

2. Install dependencies using `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry install --no-root
```

3. Run the generator script: This will generate the HTML files and output them to the `dist/` directory.

```bash
poetry run python script.py
```

4. Preview your changes: Open the generated HTML files in your browser or use a local server to serve the dist folder:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory dist 8000
```

Then, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

#### Optional: Build Automation Script

To simplify these steps, you can use the provided `local_run.sh` script. This script will automate the process.

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x local_run.sh
```

Run it with:

```bash
./local_run.sh
```
